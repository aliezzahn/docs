Change requirements:

* Need to figure out our payment model with Fist onramp providers and the CLI

* CLI changes above and beyond Fiat onramp requirement

    * developers shouldn't be prompted to choose from network options at startup. There is only one network, kras or whatever the capacity provider support network is called
    ```bash
    ? Select Fluence Environment to use by default with this project (Use arrow keys)
    ‚ùØ kras (default)
     testnet
     stage
     local
     custom
    ```
    * the incuded hello work example is wanting:
    ```
     fluence run -f 'runDeployedServices("Fluence")'

* Any chance we can cleanup Aqua to improve the developer experience?
    * ship with the hello-world Wasm service ( or better a deployed service set) as part of a getting-started template or the existing quickstart template
    * should replace service with Lambda?
    * it's still deal deploy
    * common for deployment (today):
    ```python

    ```

* Local Network Install
    * should just be the dockerized peers without payment, Fiat gateway or otherwise. both Joera and Margan complained about the current setup
