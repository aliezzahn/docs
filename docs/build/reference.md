### Libraries

Aqua is a very lean language optimized to bring accessible and ergonomic peer-to-peer choreography and composition into the hands of a broad developer base. Hence, Aqua may not provide all the features you desire or require. Not to fear! Aqua is easily extensible and the Fluence team is already providing multiple libraries for your convenience.
